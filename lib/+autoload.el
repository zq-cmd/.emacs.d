Manage a project with a Language Server Protocol (LSP) server.
The LSP server of CLASS is started (or contacted) via CONTACT.
If this operation is successful, current *and future* file
buffers of MANAGED-MAJOR-MODE inside PROJECT become \"managed\"
by the LSP server, meaning information about their contents is
exchanged periodically to provide enhanced code-analysis via
`xref-find-definitions', `flymake-mode', `eldoc-mode',
`completion-at-point', among others.
Interactively, the command attempts to guess MANAGED-MAJOR-MODE
from current buffer, CLASS and CONTACT from
`eglot-server-programs' and PROJECT from `project-current'.  If
it can't guess, the user is prompted.  With a single
\\[universal-argument] prefix arg, it always prompt for COMMAND.
With two \\[universal-argument] prefix args, also prompts for
MANAGED-MAJOR-MODE.
PROJECT is a project instance as returned by `project-current'.
CLASS is a subclass of `eglot-lsp-server'.
CONTACT specifies how to contact the server.  It is a
keyword-value plist used to initialize CLASS or a plain list as
described in `eglot-server-programs', which see.
LANGUAGE-ID is the language ID string to send to the server for
MANAGED-MAJOR-MODE, which matters to a minority of servers.
INTERACTIVE is t if called interactively.

arguably be more semantically appropriate to use

Selectrum since this causes it to select the working directory
initially.
